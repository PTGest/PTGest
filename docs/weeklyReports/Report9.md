## Backend changes

The method to get the trainees from a company was implemented, with a filter, and the method to get the trainers from a company was improved introducing filters for the search.

The filters implemented for these methods are the following:

- **getCompanyTrainees:**
    - **gender:** Gender of the trainee to search.
    - **name:** Name of the trainee that is intended to search.

- **getCompanyTrainers:**
    - **gender:** Gender of the trainer to search.
    - **availability:** Availability, ascending or descending, of the trainer according to the capacity of trainee that supports (capacity - associated trainees).
    - **name:** Name of the trainer that is intended to search.

Besides that, a bug was detected in which if a *hired trainer* was removed from the system, the trainees associated with him, were no longer associated with the company to which they belonged, in this way the trainee could not be associated with another *hired trainer*. To solve this problem, a new association was created between the company and the trainee, so that the trainee continues to be associated with the company even if the *hired trainer* is removed.

## Database changes
