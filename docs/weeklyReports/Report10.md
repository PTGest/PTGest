## Backend changes

A bug in the method to reassing a trainer to a trainee were the user can reassign the trainer that is already assigned to the trainee was fixed.

The methods to list all sets and workouts were implemented with the following filters:
    - **Workouts:**
        - **name** - filter the workouts by the names that are similar to the passed value. 
        - **muscleGroup** - filter the workouts by the muscle group.
    - **Sets:**
        - **name** - filter the sets by the names that are similar to the passed value.
        - **type** - filter the sets by the type.

The method to create a workout was changed to store in muscleGroup a list of 3 muscle groups instead of a single muscle group to be more flexible and to allow the user to create a workout that works in multiple muscle groups.

Some other methods were improved to return the correct data and to be more efficient.

The method to create a session was implemented, this method creates a new session with the following fields:
    - **Trainee Id:** Trainee Identifier.
    - **Workout Id:** Workout Identifier.
    - **Begin Date:** Date when the session should start.
